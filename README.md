I've created a UI/UX friendly website analytics dashboard that displays key metrics, traffic analytics, user behavior insights, and real-time statistics. It features a modern, clean design with interactive charts powered by Recharts, a responsive layout that adapts seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices, and a collapsible sidebar navigation for easy access to different analytics views. The standout features include comprehensive traffic source breakdown with geographical distribution, user journey visualization through page flow analysis, and a real-time statistics monitor showing live visitor activity with recent events and active pages. The dashboard uses React Router for smooth navigation between Overview, Traffic Analytics, User Behavior, and Real-time Stats sections, with optimized mobile UI including responsive typography, improved spacing, and larger touch targets for excellent usability on smaller screens. All data is currently presented using mock data for demonstration purposes. AI tools were used during the design and development process to support ideation, copy refinement, and interface decisions.
